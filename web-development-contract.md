You agree to review our work, provide feedback and sign-off approval in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways and you will also be bound by any dates that we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the annex 1 to this contract.</p>

<p>We have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from us and we will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way we will endeavour to meet all the deadlines set between us but we can&#8217;t be responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off our work on-time at any stage.</p>

<p>Rest assured, we will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give us.</p>

<p>We will [DETAILED SERVICES OVERVIEW]. If you&#8217;re not happy with the services provided at any stage, you agree to pay us in full for all of the work that we have produced until that point and you may either cancel this contract or continue to commission us to make further work at our standard hourly rate as mentioned in annex 1 to this contract. </p>

<h4>Text content and photography</h4>

<p>We are not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy unless we specified it in the original estimate. We&#8217;ll be happy to help though where we can.</p>

<p>If needed, you will supply us photographs in the appropriate digital format for use on the website & mobile applications. We can suggest vendors of stock photography if you cannot supply your own.</p>

<h4>Browser testing</h4>

<p>If the project includes HTML markup and CSS styling, we will develop these using HTML5 and CSS3. We will test all our code in current versions of all major browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Microsoft (Edge+), Mozilla (FireFox) and Google (Chrome). We will also test to ensure that pages will display visually in a similar, albeit not necessarily an identical way, in Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 for Windows as this browser lacks a lot of the functionality required for modern web development practices. Every effort will be made to gracefully degrade the website in older browsers so an to not diminish the visitors experience. </p>

<p>However, we will not test these templates in old or abandoned browsers, for example Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 (or below) for Windows or Mac, previous versions of Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or other unless otherwise specified. If you need to show the same or similar visual design to visitors using these older browsers, we will charge you at the hourly rate for any necessary additional code and its testing.</p>

<h4>Mobile app testing</h4>

<p>If the project includes mobile applications we will test all our code in the latest 2 versions of iOS and Android OS. If you need to support older versions of mobile operating systems we will charge you at the hourly rate for any necessary additional code and its testing.</p>

<h4>Website/Mobile app launch</h4>

<p>You are responsible to keep a copy of any existing website/mobile app files and/or databases. Upon launch, we are able to move existing files to your own private github repository if you advise us to do so. You are responsible for paying ongoing fees if that is the case.</p>

<p>We are committed to making you feel as comfortable as possible with your new website and/or mobile app once it is launched, however we cannot provide on-going training after launch. We will try our best to guide you in the right direction with regards to understanding the structure of the app and how it works. Should you need training on how to use it, we are able to quote this for you at our standard hourly rate. It is assumed no training is included in the quoted amount, unless specified otherwise in written correspondence.</p>

<h4>Bug fixes</h4>

<p>We are committed to producing high-quality code, but nasty bugs still happen. In course of normal work we will charge you standard hourly rate for fixing any bugs that has been found. Once the project is complete, we are committed to fixing any code bugs associated with the code we have produced within a calendar month (up to 31 days) after completion of the project. Beyond this time, we are happy to quote to perform fixes or modify the site and/or mobile app. This does not extend to any bugs in the third party code used. It will be your responsibility to keep the mobile and/or web applications up to date for security reasons, unless you contract us on a ongoing basis to do so for you. While we endeavour to code websites and/or mobile apps in a futureproof way, there may come an eventual time that modifications may be required to the site and/or mobile apps to support something in an upgrade. If this is outside the 31 day launch period we will quote on this for you.</p>

<h4>Technical support</h4>

<p>You may already have professional website hosting; you might even manage that hosting in-house; if that&#8217;s the case, great. If you don&#8217;t manage your own website hosting, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred, third-party hosting providers. We will charge you a one-off fee for installing your site on this server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics; then the updates to, and management of that server, plus any support issues will be up to you. In case you are not able to do it yourself, we are also happy to help with managing your servers based on our standard hourly rate.</p>

<h4>Hacked Website/Mobile app</h4>

<p>Getting hacked is never fun. We will always do my best to make the website we produce for you as secure as possible but we can neither be responsible for, nor accountable for your website and/or mobile app after it has been launched. We can also not be responsible for providing a backup of your website and/or mobile app files should the worst occur. Most web hosting companies will be able to provide you a recent website backup for a fee and we are also able to offer a regular backup storage service for an ongoing fee which can be discussed. That being said, if we can help out we will surely try.</p>

<h4>External Services</h4>

<p>If part of our agreement includes services that we are not able to offer, we will either recommend someone to perform these for you or we can sub-contract these on your behalf. These services may include the likes of Marketing, Copy-writing, Search Engine Marketing (SEA), Search Engine Optimization (SEO) services or other services not listed here. We endeavour to perform all web and mobile development work ourself, but if need be we reserve the right to utilize the services of third party contractors.</p>

<h4>E-commerce</h4>

<p>If your web and/or mobile development service includes the integration of online purchasing/e-commerce facilities, you will be responsible for both the set-up and ongoing costs of these services. These may include merchant gateway fees, purchase of an SSL certificate and any other fees for services provided by this third party functionality. When the time comes to integrate these services, we will endeavour to fully inform you of what costs may be involved.</p>
